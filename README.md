## Description
Check whether a domain is available or not on godaddy.com.

## Usage
godaddy-domain-checker.sh `[DOMAIN TO QUERY]`


## Development
* Requires a godaddy developer key, which you can get [here](https://developer.godaddy.com/getstarted).
Note: Demo works without a key, as it is set as a hidden environment variable in replit, however if you implement it yourself just get the key and add the followingvariables at the top of the script:

```
API_KEY="[API_KEY]"
SECRET="[API_SECRET]"

```
